long0  = Period in milliseconds between sensor/ESC updates<br>\
This value should generally be between 5000 (200Hz) and 10000(100Hz)<br>\
Controlles how often the sensors are polled and the control signal is updated \
Higher speeds will decrease the processing time left for other tasks
long1  = Factor used during sensor update step. Should be between 0.0 and 1.0 <br>\
A value of 0.0 flies completely based on the best estimate and gyroscope <br>\
As the value approaches 1.0, the quad increasingly uses the accel/mag measurement <br>\
to stabalize. This should generally be very low, only using the accel/mag to correct <br>\
error in the gyro model
long2  = Term on exponential running average of the accel/mag's correctons to the gyro <br>\
Should be between 0.0 (average of only latest value) <br>\
and 1.0 (average of only historic values)
long3  = minimum denominator in the tilt based thrust compensator
long4  = Attitude Stabilization P term<br>\
Control porportional to current error.<br>\
Generally the main driver of PID control.<br>\
Higher P makes reaction quicker, but increases overshoot and degrades stablity.
long5  = Attitude Stabilization I term<br>\
Used to eliminate steady state error, too much I can increase overshoot and degrade stability.
long6  = Attitude Stabilization D term<br>\
D Will dampen the output by predicting the future quadcopter position with linear extrapolation.<br>\
It will decrease overshoot and decrease settling time, but can cause new oscillations if set too high.
long7  = Velocity with which to return the quadcopter to a level position<br>\
The quadcopter picks a velocity to return to level linearly with angle \
This setting changes the slope of that linear equation.<br>\
Higher values will make stabalization more aggressize.
long8  = Yaw Stabilization P term<br>
long9  = Yaw Stabilization I term<br>
long10 = Yaw Stabilization D term<br>
long11 = Yaw stabilization V term<br>
long12 = Raw output throttle necessary to hover (used for throttle stick centering)<br>\
Used in the RC radio throttle stick curve equation. When the throttle stick in at 50%, \
This is what the quad's final output throttle will be at.
long13 = Affects radio throttle curve linearity<br>\
Values closer to 1.0 make the curve more linear, values near 0.0 give finer control around \
the hover point and coarse control at the bottom and top of the throttle range.

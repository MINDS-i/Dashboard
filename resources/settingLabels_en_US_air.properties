long0  = Period in milliseconds between sensor/ESC updates<br>\
This value should generally be between 5000 (200Hz) and 10000(100Hz)<br>\
Controlles how often the sensors are polled and the control signal is updated \
Higher speeds will decrease the processing time left for other tasks
long1  = Mean Square Error of the Accelerometer Reading <br>\
An estimate of the noise in accelerometer readings used by the orientation tracker.<br>\
Higher numbers suggest more error, and will cause the accelerometer's immediate signal \
to have less of an effect on orientation relative other information sources
long2  = Mean Square Error that grows with time in the internal state model <br>\
The Higher this value, the less the orientation tracker will trust its previous best \
estimates.
long3  = How strongly to bias accelerometer readings based on distance from 1g <br>\
The orientation tracker makes estimates of the error in a particular accelerometer \
reading based on how close it was to reading 1G. This value controlls how much of \
an effect this will have on the accelerometer's total mean squared error.
long4  = Attitude Stabilization P term<br>\
Control porportional to current error.<br>\
Generally the main driver of PID control.<br>\
Higher P makes reaction quicker, but increases overshoot and degrades stablity.
long5  = Attitude Stabilization I term<br>\
Used to eliminate steady state error, too much I can increase overshoot and degrade stability.
long6  = Attitude Stabilization D term<br>\
D Will dampen the output by predicting the future quadcopter position with linear extrapolation.<br>\
It will decrease overshoot and decrease settling time, but can cause new oscillations if set too high.
long7  = Velocity with which to return the quadcopter to a level position<br>\
The quadcopter picks a velocity to return to level linearly with angle \
This setting changes the slope of that linear equation.<br>\
Higher values will make stabalization more aggressize.
long8  = Yaw Stabilization P term<br>
long9  = Yaw Stabilization I term<br>
long10 = Yaw Stabilization D term<br>
long11 = Raw output throttle necessary to hover (used for throttle stick centering)<br>\
Used in the RC radio throttle stick curve equation. When the throttle stick in at 50%, \
This is what the quad's final output throttle will be at.
long12 = Affects radio throttle curve linearity<br>\
Values closer to 1.0 make the curve more linear, values near 0.0 give finer control around \
the hover point and coarse control at the bottom and top of the throttle range.

long0  = Default: 6500<br>\
Period in milliseconds between sensor/ESC updates<br>\
This value should be between 5000 (200Hz) and 10000(100Hz)<br>\
Controls how often the sensors are polled and the control signal is updated \
Higher speeds will decrease the processing time left for other tasks
long1  = Default: 0.0038<br>\
Factor used during sensor update step. Should be between 0.0 and 1.0 <br>\
A value of 0.0 flies completely based on the best estimate and gyroscope <br>\
As the value approaches 1.0, the quad increasingly uses the accel/mag measurement <br>\
to stabilize. This should generally be very low, only using the accel/mag to correct <br>\
error in the gyro model
long2  = Default: 0.99999 <br>\
Term on exponential running average of the accel/mag's corrections to the gyro <br>\
must be between 0.0 (average of only latest value) <br>\
and 1.0 (average of only historic values) <br>\
Normally very close to 1.0
long3  = Default: 1.00 <br>\
Not currently implemented
long4  = Default: 0.250 <br>\
Attitude Stabilization P term<br>\
Control proportional to current error.<br>\
Generally the main driver of PID control.<br>\
Higher P makes reaction quicker, but increases overshoot and degrades stability.
long5  = Default: 0.000 <br>\
Attitude Stabilization I term<br>\
Used to eliminate steady state error, too much I can increase overshoot and degrade stability.
long6  = Default: 0.003 <br>\
Attitude Stabilization D term<br>\
D Will dampen the output by predicting the future quadcopter position with linear extrapolation.<br>\
It will decrease overshoot and decrease settling time, but can cause new oscillations if set too high.
long7  = Default: 5.00 <br>\
P term on attitude Velocity control loop <br>\
Higher values will make stabilization more aggressive.
long8  = Default: 0.80 <br>\
I term on attitude Velocity control loop <br>\
Higher values increase response to drifting and unevent weight <br>\
Too high can cause instability and oscillations
long9  = Default: 0.17 <br>\
D term on attitude Velocity control loop <br>\
Can be used to dampen oscillations and increase P's ceiling
long10 = Default: 1.0 <br>\
Yaw Stabilization P term<br>
long11 = Default: 0.00 <br>\
Yaw Stabilization I term<br>
long12 = Default: 0.00 <br>\
Yaw Stabilization D term<br>
long13 = Default: 8.00 <br>\
Yaw stabilization V term<br>
long14 = Default: 0.40 <br>\
Raw output throttle necessary to hover (used for throttle stick centering)<br>\
Used in the RC radio throttle stick curve equation. When the throttle stick in at 50%, \
This is what the quad's final output throttle will be at.
long15 = Default: 0.37 <br>\
Affects radio throttle curve linearity<br>\
A Value of 0.5 is as linear as possible around the hover throttle<br>\
A Value of 0.0 is heavily curved for fine control around the hover point<br>\
A value of 1.0 is heavily curved for more sensitivity<br>\
A value slightly under 0.5 tends to work best (0.37 is default)
